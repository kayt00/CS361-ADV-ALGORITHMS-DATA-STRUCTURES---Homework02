# CS361-ADV-ALGORITHMS-DATA-STRUCTURES---Homework02

In this assignment I used a stack to determine if an input file is properly balanced in the sense that:
-Every `(` must be terminated by a `)`, and every `)` must terminate some `(`.
-Every `[` must be terminated by a `]`, and every `]` must terminate some `[`.
-Every `{` must be terminated by a `}`, and every `}` must terminate some `{`.
-Matching pairs of thr above characters may be nested (i.e. one within another), but may not overlap.
-All other characters are ignored.
